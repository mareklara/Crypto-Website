# Crypto-Website
Crypto Financial Website


This website is a practice one for me. Basically, what I am doing is looking at this website, https://www.revolut.com/en-US, and trying to code it based on what I see in there. I am putting in practice what I have learned so far. By doing this, I can show myself that I have actually learned and that I can code anything I see. 

I am still working on this one and I will update it as I code it.
